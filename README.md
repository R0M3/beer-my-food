## Development server

Run `npm install` if not done already.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## What next?

There is no backend yet for this project, in the time frame given i believe this horizontally sliced solution gives the best usability. In the future a backend for favouriting / saving beers and reviewing could be implemeneted.

Testing properly implemented.

Better security by implementing better type casting, CSP, and XSS prevention - although angular generally handles this quite well.

Error handling system by overriding the angular module and providing custom responses.

Browser compatibility.

Better accessibility.

BEM.

Design improvements!

With more features will come more modularity for both the ngrx and components.

...and lots more!
